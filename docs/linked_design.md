## Introduction
### Linked design

![Linked design](/public/linked_design.png)


You can control the appearance of web pages right from Lunacy. The feature that we call **linked design** lets you update designs in Lunacy and then apply the changes to the web page. This applies to:

* Texts
* Images
* Layer and text styles
* Color variables

#### How it works for a web developer

Switching to linked design might slightly impact your standard practices at the beginning, but will save you lots of time and efforts later on. 

The procedure is as follows:

1. Deselect all layers on the canvas.
2. Open the **Export** tab in the right panel.
3. Copy the code with the link to the CSS file and paste it to the head section of your HTML code.

    Later on, stick to the CSS styles and color variables from this file in your code. To see the CSS code generated by Lunacy, open the link to the CSS file in your browser.

4. In the same panel, copy the code with the script for fetching text content and paste it under the body section of your HTML code.

5. One by one, select the layers/layer groups subject to updates from Lunacy, copy their code in the **Export** panel and paste it to your HTML code.


#### How it works for a graphic designer

The only difference from your standard flow will be the work with raster images. You should wrap all the raster images subject to updates into layer groups.

Even if an image is standalone by design, create a dummy vector layer below the image and then group them.

When making changes to your design, which is already a live webpage, proceed as follows:

1. Select the altered layer/layer group.
2. Open the **Export** tab in the right panel.
3. Click ![refresh button](/public/refresh_icon.png) next to the **Linked Design** section. This will apply the changes to the web page.

4. Repeat as needed.

<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><p>Do not rename layer and text styles after the design is online</p><p>Do not add new styles, if you don't won't to bother your web developers. Edit your current styles instead.</p>
</div>

In the **Export** panel:

* Copy the link to the CSS file in Lunacy and add it to your HTML document. Stick to the CSS styles and color variables in the code.
* Write a JS script for fetching the JSON file with text content key/value pairs and a function that will output text by key values. Add texts to your HTML document using this function and respective keys. 
* Add graphic content as PNG/SVG links to our Lunacy cloud (covered by CDN).

Thatâ€™s it! Now your graphic designers can update the page by themselves.
