You can control the appearance of web pages right from Lunacy. The feature that we call **linked design** lets you update designs in Lunacy and then apply the changes to the web page. This works with changes in:

* Colors
* Styling effects (borders, shadows, etc.)
* Layer shapes
* Layer sizes
* Text and raster content

## How it works for a web developer

Switching to linked design might slightly impact your standard practices at the beginning, but will save you lots of time and efforts later on. 

The procedure is as follows:

1. Deselect all layers on the canvas.
2. Open the **Export** tab in the right panel.
3. Copy the code with the link to the CSS file and paste it to the head section of your HTML code.

    Later on, stick to the CSS styles and color variables from this file in your code. To see the CSS code generated by Lunacy, open the link to the CSS file in your browser.

4. In the same panel, copy the code with the script for fetching text content and paste it under the body section of your HTML code.

5. One by one, select the layers/layer groups subject to updates from Lunacy, copy their code in the **Export** panel and paste it to your HTML code.

Here's also a short video explainer:

## How it works for a graphic designer

To make sure that your linked design works properly, mind the following rules:

* The use of <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/" target="_blank">text styles</a> is a MUST.
* Wrap all the raster images subject to updates into layer groups. Even if an image is standalone by design, create a dummy vector layer below the image and make a group.
* DO NOT rename layer and text styles after the design is online.
* DO NOT add new styles, if you don't won't to bother your web developers. Edit your current styles instead.


To apply changes to a live webpage, proceed as follows.

**For non-text layers:**

1. Select the altered layer/layer group.
2. Open the **Export** tab in the right panel.
3. Click ![refresh button](/public/refresh_icon.png) next to the **Linked Design** section. This will apply the changes to the web page.

    **Tip:** If ![refresh button](/public/refresh_icon.png) appears disabled, click the question mark next to it first.

4. Repeat as needed.

**For text layers:**

1. When you're done with all edits of text layers, deselect all layers on the canvas (press `Esc` or click anywhere over the canvas).
2. Click ![refresh button](/public/refresh_icon.png) next to the **Linked Design** section. This will apply the changes to the web page.

To see the changes, reload the page by pressing `Ctrl//⌘ ⌥ R`, to make sure that the cached content is cleared.
